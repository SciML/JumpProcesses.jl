It holds the utilities for building jump equations, like stochastic simulation algorithms (SSAs), Gillespie methods or Kinetic Monte Carlo methods; and for building jump diffusions. It is one of the core solver libraries included in DifferentialEquations.jl.  Users interested in using this functionality should see the  DifferentialEquations.jl documentation.
