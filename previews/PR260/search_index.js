For example, to  simulate a collection of jump processes for which the transition rates are constant between jumps (called ConstantRateJumps or MassActionJumps), we must first construct a DiscreteProblem\n\nprob = DiscreteProblem(u0, p, tspan)\n\nwhere u0 is the initial condition, p the parameters and tspan the time span. If we wanted to have the jumps coupled with a system of ODEs, or have transition rates with explicit time dependence, we would use an ODEProblem instead that defines the ODE portion of the dynamics.\n\nGiven prob we define the jumps via\n\nJumpProblem(prob, aggregator::AbstractAggregatorAlgorithm, jumps::JumpSet ; kwargs...)\nJumpProblem(prob, aggregator::AbstractAggregatorAlgorithm, jumps...; kwargs...)\n\nHere aggregator specifies the underlying algorithm for calculating next jump times and types, for example Direct.
