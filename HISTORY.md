# Breaking updates and feature summaries across releases

## JumpProcesses unreleased (master branch)

## 9.3

  - Support for "bounded" `VariableRateJump`s that can be used with the `Coevolve`
    aggregator for faster simulation of jump processes with time-dependent rates.
    In particular, if all `VariableRateJump`s in a pure-jump system are bounded one
    can use `Coevolve` with `SSAStepper` for better performance. See the
    documentation, particularly the first and second tutorials, for details on
    defining and using bounded `VariableRateJump`s.
